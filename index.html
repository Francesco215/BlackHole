    <h1>Some consequences of Black Hole Thermodynamics</h1>
    <p>
        The maximum entropy a region of space can cointain is proportional to the surface area, this would lead
        to a paradox if the region of space is infinite, here we explore the hypotesis and some consequences

        <h2 id="no_flat">Why a universe can't be flat and infinite</h2>
        <p>
            The entropy of a black hole is <d-cite key="Hawking"></d-cite>
        
        <d-math block>S_b=\frac{k_bc^3}{4G\hbar}A=\alpha V^{2/3}</d-math>
        where
        <d-math block>\alpha=\frac{k_bc^3}{4G\hbar}\sqrt[3]{\pi}\bigg(\frac34\bigg)</d-math>
        and $A$ and $V$ are the area and the volume of the black hole, Therefore the entropy per unit volume of a black hole
        is
        <d-math block>s_b=\frac {S_b}V=\frac\alpha{\sqrt[3]{V}}</d-math>
        And it decreases as the volume of the black hole gets larger and larger.</p>
        <p>
        The main property of black holes that we are going to keep in mind is that a black hole of volume $V$ has the maximum entropy any spherical volume $V$ can have.
        Suppose we have a universe enclosed in a volume of radius $R$ and that on large scales we can say that it
        has constant entropy density $s_u=\frac{dS_u}{dV}$. Therefore the maximum volume $V_{max}$ of this universe is.
        <d-math block>
            V_{max}=\bigg(\frac \alpha{s_u}\bigg)^3
        </d-math>
        Therefore the univere can’t be infinite if it is homogeneus on large scales and flat
        </p>
        <h3 id="maronn">Why it expands</h3>
        <p>
            Suppose the volume of the Universe for some reason is exactly $V_{max}$ it would last a blink of an eye before
            collapsing into a black hole. That is because the total entropy has to increase. If the universe has some kind of law that
            keeps it’s volume always equal to $V_{max}$ we would have an expanding universe.
            <d-footnote>This could explain why our universe in expanding, and why the expantion of the universe
            isn’t constant throught the age of the universe.</d-footnote>
        </p>
        <p>
          However this would mean that the universe has some kind of edge. This seems off, but we can start from this
          to make a better theory for universes that are not flat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way of interpreting the rate of expation of the universe it that the expation on the universe
            is such that the entropy of the cosmologiacal event horizon must be equal of less to the entropy of the
            suff contained inside
        </p>
        <h3 id="remarks">Some remarks</h3>
        <p>
            If the universe can be described by a single wavefunction $|\textrm{Universe}\rangle$,
            than by definition the total entropy of the universe will be zero, that being said, if you
            consider finite region of space
            <d-footnote>
                It can be said equivalently that you don't know anything about the universe is outside a region of space,
                this makes the entropy for a limited region of space non zero since you do the partial trace over
                everything that is outside that volume
            </d-footnote>
            , than the entropy can be considered non zero and the paradox reappears for a large enough volume 
        </p>
        <h2 id="hyperbolic">What happens in hyperbolic space</h2>
        <p>
          <!--
            Another way this paradox can be averted is by having a space that is hyperbolic,
            for a large radius the surface of a sphere and the area are the same, so this problem
            can be averted, but not always.
          -->
          Let's consider a simple hyperbolic space in two dimentions, the circumference $C$ and the area $A$ are
          <d-cite key="hyperbolic_circle"></d-cite>
          <d-math block>
            C(r,\tau)=\frac{2\pi}{\tau} \sinh (r\tau) \quad \quad A(r,\tau)=\frac{4\pi}{\tau^2} \sinh^2 ( r\tau/2)
          </d-math>
          Where $\tau$ represents how much the space is hyperbolic, for $\tau=0$ the space is flat.
          <d-footnote>Controllare che le formule siano corrette, il modo in cui le ho ricavate io è cambiando unità di misura</d-footnote>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can imagine that is this 2D universe the maximum amount of entropy is proportional to the circumference
          $S_{max}(r,\tau)=s_b C(r,\tau)$.          
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can imagine that our 2D universe has a constant entropy density per unit area $S_u(r,\tau)=s_uA(r,\tau)$.
          Just like before we must impose that
          <d-math block>S_u(r,\tau)\le S_{max}(r,\tau)</d-math>
          Now some quick calculations...
          <d-math block>s_u\frac{4\pi}{\tau^2}\sinh^2(r\tau/2)\le s_b \frac{2\pi}{\tau} \sinh(r\tau)</d-math>
          <d-math block>\frac 2\tau \frac{\sinh^2(r\tau/2)}{\sinh (r\tau)}\le \frac{s_b}{s_u}</d-math>
          And we have that
          <d-math block>\frac 1\tau\tanh(r\tau/2)\le \frac{s_b}{s_u}</d-math>
          This must be true for all $r$, since $\max\big[\tanh(r)\big]=\tanh(\infty)=1$ we have that for hyperbolic space
          <d-math block>s_u\le s_b\tau</d-math>
          So that we have a more generalized upper limit to the density of entropy per unit volume of the universe.
          Notice how for $\tau=0$ we get the result that the universe must have $s_u=0$,
          which is the result we obtained previously.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have that $s_u=s_b\tau$ we get that in order for the universe to not collapse it has to increase
          the curvature or the volume <d-footnote>Non è che per caso le due cose sono equivalenti?</d-footnote>
